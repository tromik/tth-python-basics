# Let's calculate, with a bit of imprecision, how many days old you are.
# First, create a variable named years. Assign years to the number of years old you are.
# This should be an integer.

# Great! Now we need to multiply the number years by the number of days in a year.
# We'll ignore leap years, so just multiply years by 365 and assign it to the variable days.
#
# Let's do one more calculation.
# Make a new variable named weeks. Give it the value of days divided by 7.

years = 36
days = years * 365

weeks = days / 7
